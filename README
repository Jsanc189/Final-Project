Final Project: Sussy Tomato Pizzaria

---------------------------
Description
In this project, the goal is to have the user make different types of food typically found in a pizzeria.
Utilizing the p5.js library, an environment is generated utilizing png files while also utilizing classes
to differentiate between different types of ingredients and tools.  The sketch.js produces the environment
fot a user to interact with these different objects to make pizza or other types of food, depending on the
allotted recipes read in through the food.json.  

-----------------------------
FILES
food.js
Creates a food object based on the json file read in through the sketch.js.  Each object has a list of other
objects it can iteract with to make other food objects, and also draws each object.

food.json
This file contains all the food and tool objects and their combinations with other objects to create new
food items.

ingredientGroup.js
This file allows for large combinations of food to be reduced down to one new food item
despite having a large list of ingredients.

oven.js
This file will process multiple things put into the oven and hold them into a list for
later processing from ingredientGroup.js

sketch.js
This file is the canvas that contains all the visual and interactibility for the user 
to see.

index.html
This file includes the p5.js libraries needed for the program as well as the placement of the canvas into the webpage.


INSTRUCTIONS
This set of programs is intended to run using JavaScript utilizing the p5.js library.  The
user can click and drag items to other items in the scene to make different combinations.  
These combinations happen with other food items or tool items.
